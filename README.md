Rally-ruby-api
==============

Some codes I've tried on interacting with rally through ruby

Check rally_query.rb file in the repository



#Notes:
1. Querying in rally is fairly simple once the concept is understood
2. Whenever any query is executed on rally, most of the times what we get as result is an object
3. This object contains all the details of it in key value pairs. If you have worked on ruby, this would be similar to hashes
